# Tab's Libretab

This is an OpenSCAD model to create various styles of Archery Tabs and attachments.

It is designed to be scalable based on the hand size of the archer.

This has also been a learning curve for me to learn OpenSCAD. As such, some of the earlier tab shapes are not as scalable.

There will also be limit where if you scale too small, you may have to remove some of the holes as they'll overlap with the 
edge of object.

Please feel free to submit PRs for your mods or additions.
